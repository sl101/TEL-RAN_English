Successful for myself, I determine the qualitative changes in my professional skills. Integration with the team. Criteria can be an analysis of various technical indicators and reviews of colleagues and authorities.
In general, I feel success when, after a certain period of time in the team, I understand that I can do my work during the time and better than before. I feel that I can easily cope with my tasks and can bring more advantages in the team.

When working on a project or as a member of a team, I consider the following factors to determine if we are successful:

Meeting project goals: The success of a project is often measured by whether or not it achieves its goals. As a team member, I ensure that we are clear about our objectives and work collaboratively to achieve them.

Delivering high-quality work: Delivering high-quality work is crucial to success. I make sure that we produce work that meets the requirements and standards set for the project, and that we are continuously improving our processes and deliverables.

Meeting deadlines: Meeting project deadlines is important to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. I prioritize tasks, monitor progress, and communicate regularly with the team to ensure that we are on track to meet our deadlines.

Effective communication: Effective communication is key to the success of any team project. I strive to communicate clearly and regularly with team members, stakeholders, and other project participants, to ensure that everyone is informed, aligned, and working towards the same goals.

Positive team dynamics: Success also depends on having a positive team dynamic. I believe that building strong relationships with team members, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, and encouraging open communication and feedback, are all important for achieving success in any team project.
