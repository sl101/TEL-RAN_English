Hello!
My name is Viacheslav Zhevaha.
I am from Ukraine and now I live in Germany in Berlin.
I have an economic education as an accountant. 
I have experience of working in large international companies in contact with a large number of people.
My first IT experience was developing an MVP application for an insurance company. I worked as the head of one of the sales departments and suggested that the management develop their own application for selling insurance products.
I failed to get the management interested.
But then I was very interested in the development process itself. At first I was interested in it as a hobby. I was trying to write simple Android applications. Then I took a Java language course.
During my training, I had an experience of developing in a team. 
Then I began to think that programming could be my new profession.  
Later, I became interested in developing a web interface. Independently studied the layout of the site and related technologies. Now I have the opportunity to get professional training in front-end development courses at TELRAN courses.
I decided to take up programming professionally and become a specialist in this field.
